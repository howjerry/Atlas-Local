name: Excessive Function Parameters
description: >
  Detects function declarations with six or more parameters. Functions with
  too many parameters are hard to understand, test, and call correctly.
  This often indicates the function is doing too much or that parameters
  should be grouped into a struct.

  Group related parameters into a struct or options type. Use the functional
  options pattern for configurable behaviour. Consider whether the function
  has too many responsibilities and should be split into smaller functions.
