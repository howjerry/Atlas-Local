name: Empty Conditional Block
description: >
  Detects if statements with empty bodies. An empty conditional block suggests
  either incomplete implementation or dead code. If the condition has side
  effects, the intent should be made explicit; otherwise, the block should be
  filled with logic or removed entirely.

  Add the missing logic to the if block, or remove the empty conditional
  entirely if it serves no purpose. If the empty body is intentional, add
  a comment explaining why.
