name: Redundant Boolean Return
description: >
  Detects if-else blocks that return true in one branch and false in the
  other. This pattern is redundant because the condition expression itself
  is already a boolean that can be returned directly, making the code
  simpler and more idiomatic.

  Return the condition directly instead of wrapping it in an if-else. For
  example, replace `if x > 0 { return true } else { return false }` with
  `return x > 0`. If the condition needs to be negated, use the ! operator.
