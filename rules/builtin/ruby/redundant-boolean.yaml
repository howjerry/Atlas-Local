name: Redundant Boolean Return in Conditional
description: >
  Detects if/else blocks that return `true` in one branch and `false` in
  the other. This pattern is redundant because the condition itself is
  already a boolean expression. The entire if/else can be replaced with
  the condition directly or its negation.

  Replace the if/else with the condition directly. For example, replace
  `if condition then true else false end` with just `condition`. If the
  branches are reversed, use `!condition` or add a double negation `!!expr`
  to coerce to boolean.
