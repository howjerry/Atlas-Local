name: Nested Ternary Expression
description: >
  Detects ternary expressions nested inside other ternary expressions.
  Nested ternary operators are difficult to read and understand, making
  code harder to maintain and more prone to logic errors. They should be
  refactored into if-else statements or extracted into helper functions.

  Refactor nested ternary expressions into if-else statements or extract
  the logic into a named helper function. For example, replace
  `a ? b ? 1 : 2 : 3` with an if-else block or a function like
  `function getValueFromConditions(a, b) { if (a && b) return 1; ... }`.
