name: Magic Number Literal
description: >
  Detects numeric literals with values of 100 or greater used directly in
  code without being assigned to a named constant. Magic numbers reduce
  code readability because their purpose is unclear. Extracting them into
  named constants makes the code self-documenting and easier to maintain.

remediation: >
  Extract the numeric literal into a named constant with a descriptive
  name that explains its purpose. For example, replace `if (retries > 300)`
  with `const MAX_RETRIES = 300; if (retries > MAX_RETRIES)`.
