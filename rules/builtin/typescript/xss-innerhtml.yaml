name: XSS via innerHTML Assignment
description: >
  Detects assignment to the innerHTML property of DOM elements. Setting
  innerHTML with untrusted data allows an attacker to inject arbitrary
  HTML and JavaScript, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
  that can steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf
  of the victim.

remediation: >
  Use textContent or innerText for plain text content. For HTML content,
  use a sanitization library such as DOMPurify before assigning to
  innerHTML. Alternatively, use safe DOM APIs like createElement and
  appendChild to build DOM structures programmatically.
  For example, replace `el.innerHTML = userInput` with
  `el.textContent = userInput` or `el.innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput)`.
