name: Empty Conditional Block
description: >
  Detects if statements with empty consequence blocks. An empty if block
  suggests incomplete implementation, dead code, or a logic error where
  intended behavior was never written. It can mask bugs and confuse
  maintainers.

remediation: >
  Implement the intended logic inside the if block. If the block is
  intentionally empty, add a comment explaining why, or restructure
  the code to eliminate the empty branch. Consider inverting the
  condition if only the else branch contains logic.
