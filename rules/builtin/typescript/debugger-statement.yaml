name: Debugger Statement

  Detects usage of the debugger statement. Debugger statements are used
  during development to trigger breakpoints but should never be present
  in production code. They can halt execution in browsers, cause
  performance issues, and expose debugging information to end users.

  breakpoints in your IDE or browser DevTools instead. For logging,
  use a structured logging library with configurable log levels.
