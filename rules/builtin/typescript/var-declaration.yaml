name: Var Declaration
description: >
  Detects usage of `var` keyword for variable declarations. In modern
  TypeScript/JavaScript, `let` and `const` provide block scoping and should
  be preferred over function-scoped `var`.

remediation: >
  Replace `var` with `const` for values that don't change, or `let` for
  values that need reassignment. Both provide block-level scoping, preventing
  common scope-related bugs.
