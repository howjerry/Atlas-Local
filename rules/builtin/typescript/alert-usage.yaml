name: Alert Function Usage
description: >
  Detects calls to the alert() function. Alert dialogs are debugging
  artifacts that block the UI thread, provide a poor user experience,
  and should never appear in production web applications. They can also
  be exploited for social engineering attacks.

  Replace alert() calls with proper UI notifications such as toast
  messages, modal dialogs from a component library, or structured
  logging. For user-facing messages, use a notification system like
  react-toastify, notistack, or a custom notification component.
