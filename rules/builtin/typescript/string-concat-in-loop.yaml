name: String Concatenation in Loop
description: >
  Detects string concatenation using the += operator inside for loops.
  Repeated string concatenation in loops creates a new string object on
  each iteration, resulting in O(n^2) time complexity. For large datasets,
  this causes significant performance degradation.

  Collect values in an array and join them at the end with Array.join().
  For example, replace the loop with `const parts: string[] = [];` then
  `parts.push(item);` inside the loop, and `const result = parts.join('');`
  after the loop.
