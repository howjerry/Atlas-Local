name: Loose Equality Operator
description: >
  Detects usage of loose equality operators (== and !=) instead of strict
  equality (=== and !==). Loose equality performs type coercion which can
  lead to unexpected behavior.
severity: medium
category: quality
language: TypeScript
confidence: high
pattern: |
  (binary_expression operator: ["==" "!="]) @match
remediation: >
  Replace == with === and != with !==. Strict equality avoids type coercion
  and makes comparisons explicit and predictable.
