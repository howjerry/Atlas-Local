name: Redundant Boolean Return in Conditional
description: >
  Detects if/else blocks that return True in one branch and False in the other.
  This pattern is redundant because the condition itself is already a boolean
  expression that can be returned directly. The redundant if/else adds
  unnecessary complexity and reduces readability.

remediation: >
  Return the condition directly instead of wrapping it in an if/else. Replace
  `if condition: return True else: return False` with `return condition`. If the
  condition is not already a boolean, use `return bool(condition)`.
