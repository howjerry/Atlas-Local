name: Pass in Except Block
description: >
  Detects except blocks that contain only a `pass` statement. This silently
  swallows exceptions without any handling, logging, or recovery, making it
  difficult to diagnose issues.

  Replace `pass` with appropriate error handling. At minimum, log the
  exception. If the exception is truly ignorable, add a comment explaining why
  and consider using `contextlib.suppress()`.
