name: Empty Conditional Block
description: >
  Detects if, elif, or else blocks whose body contains only a `pass` statement.
  Empty conditional blocks are typically leftover scaffolding, dead code, or
  incomplete implementations. They obscure the intended control flow and should
  be completed or removed.

  Implement the conditional block body or remove the entire if statement if the
  condition is no longer relevant. If the empty block is intentional (e.g.,
  deliberately ignoring a case), add a comment explaining the rationale.
