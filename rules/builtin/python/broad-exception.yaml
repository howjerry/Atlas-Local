name: Broad Exception Catching
description: >
  Detects except clauses that catch the broad `Exception` class. Catching
  `Exception` is overly broad and can mask bugs by silently catching unexpected
  errors such as TypeError, AttributeError, or other programming errors that
  should be fixed rather than handled. It makes debugging difficult because the
  actual error type is hidden.

remediation: >
  Catch specific exception types instead of the broad `Exception` class. For
  example, use `except ValueError:` or `except (KeyError, TypeError):` to handle
  only the expected error conditions. If you must catch a broad exception for
  logging purposes, re-raise it after logging with `raise`.
