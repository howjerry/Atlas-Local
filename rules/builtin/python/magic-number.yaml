name: Magic Number in Comparison
description: >
  Detects numeric literals (other than 0 and 1) used directly in comparison
  expressions. Magic numbers make code harder to understand and maintain.
  Extracting them into named constants improves readability and makes the
  intent of the comparison clear.

  Extract the magic number into a named constant with a descriptive name.
  For example, replace `if temperature > 212:` with
  `BOILING_POINT = 212; if temperature > BOILING_POINT:`.
