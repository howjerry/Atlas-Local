name: Empty Function Body
description: >
  Detects functions whose body consists solely of a `pass` statement. Empty
  function stubs are often leftover scaffolding or incomplete implementations
  that should be completed or removed. Functions with only a docstring are not
  flagged, as docstring-only bodies are a valid pattern for abstract methods
  and interface definitions.

remediation: >
  Implement the function body or remove the function if it is no longer needed.
  If the function is intentionally a no-op, add a docstring explaining why, or
  use `...` (Ellipsis) to indicate an intentional placeholder in abstract
  methods.
