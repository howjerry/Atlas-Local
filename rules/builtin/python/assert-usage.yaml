name: Assert Statement for Runtime Validation
description: >
  Detects usage of `assert` statements which are intended for debugging and are
  removed when Python runs with the `-O` (optimize) flag. Using assert for
  runtime validation such as input checking or precondition enforcement means
  those checks silently disappear in optimized mode, potentially leading to
  security vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior in production.

  Replace `assert` with explicit validation using `if` statements and raise
  appropriate exceptions. For example, replace `assert user_id > 0` with
  `if user_id <= 0: raise ValueError("user_id must be positive")`. Keep assert
  only for development-time invariant checks that should never fail.
