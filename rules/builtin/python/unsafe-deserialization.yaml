name: Unsafe Deserialization via pickle or yaml.load
description: >
  Detects use of pickle.loads, pickle.load, and yaml.load which can
  execute arbitrary code during deserialization. The pickle module is
  inherently unsafe for untrusted data, and yaml.load without specifying
  a safe Loader (such as SafeLoader) will use the unsafe FullLoader by
  default. An attacker who controls the serialized data can achieve remote
  code execution.

remediation: >
  For pickle: avoid deserializing untrusted data entirely. If you must use
  serialization, prefer safe formats like JSON. For yaml: always use
  yaml.safe_load instead of yaml.load, or explicitly specify
  Loader=yaml.SafeLoader. Consider using yaml.CSafeLoader for better
  performance with the same safety guarantees.
