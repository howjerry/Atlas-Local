name: Global Statement Usage
description: >
  Detects usage of the `global` statement which modifies module-level variables
  from within a function. Global variables create implicit dependencies between
  functions, make code harder to test and reason about, and can lead to subtle
  bugs in concurrent environments. They violate encapsulation principles and
  make the data flow difficult to trace.

  Refactor the code to avoid using global state. Pass values as function
  parameters and return results instead. For shared state, use a class with
  instance attributes, or use a module-level configuration object. If mutable
  global state is genuinely needed, consider using a singleton pattern or
  dependency injection.
