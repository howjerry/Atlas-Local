name: Nested Conditional Expression (Ternary)
description: >
  Detects nested conditional expressions (ternary operators) in Python. Nested
  ternary expressions like `a if x else (b if y else c)` are difficult to read
  and understand. They should be refactored into explicit if/elif/else blocks
  or separated into multiple statements for clarity.

remediation: >
  Refactor nested conditional expressions into explicit if/elif/else statements.
  For example, replace `result = a if x else b if y else c` with a multi-line
  if/elif/else block that clearly expresses the branching logic.
