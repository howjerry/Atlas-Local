name: Empty Finally Block
description: >
  Detects try-finally blocks where the finally clause has an empty body.
  An empty finally block serves no purpose and may indicate forgotten
  cleanup logic such as resource disposal or state restoration.

remediation: >
  Implement the finally block with necessary cleanup logic (e.g. disposing
  resources, releasing locks, restoring state), or remove the finally
  clause entirely if no cleanup is needed. Consider using a `using`
  statement for automatic resource disposal.
