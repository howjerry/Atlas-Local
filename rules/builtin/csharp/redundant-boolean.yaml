name: Redundant Boolean Comparison
description: >
  Detects comparisons of boolean expressions against boolean literals
  (e.g. `if (x == true)` or `if (y != false)`). These comparisons
  are redundant and reduce readability.

  Remove the redundant boolean literal comparison. Use `if (x)`
  instead of `if (x == true)` and `if (!x)` instead of
  `if (x != true)` or `if (x == false)`.
