name: Excessive Method Parameters
description: >
  Detects methods with six or more parameters. Methods with too many
  parameters are difficult to call correctly, hard to test, and often
  indicate that the method is doing too much or that related parameters
  should be grouped into an object.

remediation: >
  Reduce the number of parameters by grouping related values into a
  class or struct (Parameter Object pattern), using a builder pattern,
  or splitting the method into smaller focused methods. For example,
  create a configuration object to hold related parameters.
