name: Use of global Keyword
description: >
  Detects use of the global keyword which imports variables from the
  global scope into a function. Global state makes code harder to test,
  reason about, and maintain. It creates hidden dependencies between
  functions and the global scope.

  Pass required values as function parameters instead of using global
  variables. Use dependency injection to provide dependencies. If shared
  state is needed, consider using a class with instance properties or
  a configuration object.
