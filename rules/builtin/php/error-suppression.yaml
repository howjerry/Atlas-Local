name: Error Suppression Operator
description: >
  Detects use of the @ error suppression operator which silences error
  messages. This hides potential problems and makes debugging difficult.
  Errors should be handled properly rather than suppressed.

  Remove the @ operator and handle errors explicitly. Use try-catch
  blocks for operations that may throw exceptions. Use error_reporting()
  and set_error_handler() to manage error levels appropriately.
  Check return values instead of suppressing errors.
