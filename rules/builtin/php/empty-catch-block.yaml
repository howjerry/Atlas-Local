name: Empty Catch Block
description: >
  Detects try-catch blocks where the catch clause has an empty body.
  Empty catch blocks silently swallow exceptions, hiding errors and
  making debugging extremely difficult. Errors should be logged,
  re-thrown, or handled explicitly.

  Handle the caught exception explicitly. Log the error, re-throw it,
  or wrap it in a more specific exception. If intentionally ignoring,
  add a comment explaining why.
