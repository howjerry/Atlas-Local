name: Empty Function Body
description: >
  Detects functions with empty bodies. An empty function body often indicates
  stub code that was never implemented, or a callback/event handler that
  silently ignores events. This can lead to subtle bugs and makes intent
  unclear.

  Implement the function body with appropriate logic. If the function is
  intentionally empty (e.g., a no-op override), add a comment explaining
  why. Consider using an abstract function if subclasses should provide
  the implementation.
