name: Mutable Variable Could Be Immutable
description: >
  Detects usage of 'var' for property declarations. In Kotlin, immutability
  is preferred. Using 'val' where possible makes code easier to reason about
  and helps prevent accidental mutation bugs. Review whether the variable
  truly needs to be mutable.

  If the variable is never reassigned, change 'var' to 'val' to make it
  immutable. Prefer 'val' by default and only use 'var' when reassignment
  is truly needed.
