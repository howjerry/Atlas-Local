name: Empty Method Body
description: >
  Detects methods with empty bodies. An empty method body often indicates
  stub code that was never implemented, or a callback/event handler that
  silently ignores events. This can lead to subtle bugs and makes intent
  unclear.

  Implement the method body with appropriate logic. If the method is
  intentionally empty (e.g. a no-op override), add a comment explaining
  why. Consider using an abstract method if subclasses should provide
  the implementation.
