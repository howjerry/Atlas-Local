name: Magic Number in Code
description: >
  Detects magic numbers (unexplained numeric literals) used as arguments
  in method calls. Magic numbers reduce code readability and make
  maintenance difficult because the intent behind the value is unclear.
  Extract these values into named constants with descriptive names.

  Extract magic numbers into named constants (static final fields) with
  descriptive names that explain the purpose of the value. For example,
  replace `Thread.sleep(3600000)` with
  `private static final long ONE_HOUR_MS = 3600000;` and
  `Thread.sleep(ONE_HOUR_MS)`.
