name: Excessive Method Parameters
description: >
  Detects methods with six or more parameters. Methods with too many
  parameters are hard to understand, test, and maintain. They often
  indicate that the method is doing too much or that the parameters
  should be grouped into a dedicated object (Parameter Object pattern).

remediation: >
  Reduce the number of parameters by introducing a Parameter Object or
  Builder pattern. Group related parameters into a class and pass an
  instance of that class instead. For example, replace
  `void create(String name, String email, String phone, String addr, String city, String zip)`
  with `void create(UserInfo info)` where UserInfo encapsulates all fields.
