name: Empty Conditional Block
description: >
  Detects if statements with empty consequence or alternative blocks. An
  empty conditional body usually indicates incomplete implementation,
  accidentally deleted code, or a forgotten placeholder. It makes the
  code confusing to read and may hide logic errors.

  Add the intended logic to the empty conditional block. If the condition
  is intentionally empty (e.g. future placeholder), add a comment
  explaining why. Consider removing the entire if statement if the
  condition and its body are no longer needed.
