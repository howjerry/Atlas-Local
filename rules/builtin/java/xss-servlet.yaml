name: XSS via Servlet Response Writer
description: >
  Detects potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Java
  Servlets where data is written directly to the HTTP response via
  PrintWriter methods such as print, println, write, format, or append.
  If the data written to the response includes unsanitized user input,
  an attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's
  browser, potentially stealing session cookies, credentials, or
  performing actions on behalf of the user.
severity: high
category: security
language: Java
cwe_id: CWE-79

remediation: >
  Encode all user-controlled data before writing it to the HTTP response.
  Use OWASP Java Encoder or similar libraries to HTML-encode output. For
  example, replace `out.println(request.getParameter("name"))` with
  `out.println(Encode.forHtml(request.getParameter("name")))`. Consider
  using templating engines with automatic output encoding, such as
  Thymeleaf or JSP with JSTL's c:out tag. Set the Content-Type header
  appropriately and use Content-Security-Policy headers as defense in depth.
