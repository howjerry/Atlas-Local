name: Boolean Method Without Proper Naming
description: >
  Detects methods returning boolean that do not follow the conventional
  naming pattern (is/has/can/should/will/was/are/contains/exists prefix).
  Boolean methods with non-standard names reduce readability and violate
  the JavaBeans naming convention. Properly named boolean methods make
  the code self-documenting.

remediation: >
  Rename the method to follow the boolean naming convention by adding
  an appropriate prefix. For example, rename `boolean valid()` to
  `boolean isValid()`, `boolean permission()` to `boolean hasPermission()`,
  or `boolean delete()` to `boolean canDelete()`.
